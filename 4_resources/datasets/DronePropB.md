## 1. Description

The data article presents vibration datasets for faulty propellers collected from over 100 experiments involving various combinations of drones, fault types, fault severities, and operating speeds during ground testing. This dataset is the largest publicly available collection focused on faulty drone propellers. Vibration measurements are obtained using four accelerometers: three onboard accelerometers integrated into the inertial measurement unit (IMU) and an additional highly sensitive piezo accelerometer secured to the drone during ground testing. All identified faults occur while the drone operates normally, without significant performance degradation across all flight phases.
