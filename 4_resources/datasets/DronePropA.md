## 1. Description

This data article introduces a comprehensive dataset composed of motion trajectories and flight logs of 130 experimental indoor flights. The faulty propellers involve three fault types for all trajectories: an edge cut, a crack, and a surface cut. In addition, there are three fault severity levels for each type. The first trajectory is a cross shape, where the drone moves back and forth along the diagonals of a 1x1m square. The second trajectory is square-shaped, with the drone following the four edges of a 1x1m square. In the third trajectory, the drone ascends in increments of 0.2m from an altitude of 0.2m to 0.8m, while in the fourth, it climbs directly from 0.2m to 0.8m. Finally, the fifth trajectory involves a yawing maneuver, with the drone rotating by 45, -45, 90, and -90 degrees. The main experiments are conducted on one drone, covering all nine combinations of fault types and severity levels, as well as the healthy condition, at two maximum translational and yawing speeds respectively: (0.33 m/s, 0.52 rad/s) and (2.00 m/s, 3.14 rad/s). Each healthy case is repeated three times. Additionally, two other drones in healthy condition are tested across all trajectories at the maximum speed of (2.00 m/s, 3.14 rad/s). DronePropA is the first batch of flight tests, and additional batches will be published for outdoor conditions and additional fault types.
